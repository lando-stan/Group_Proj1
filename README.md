# **kTV Online â€” Group Project 1**

For our first group project, we made an online application to sing karaoke. We achieved this by pulling media and lyrics from two different server-side APIs: Youtube and Genius.

# Application Instructions

Search for a song on the searchbar and click the search button. Alternatively, you can try an advanced search by clicking the checkbox and submitting additional parameters. Listen to your favorite song by listening to the YouTube embeddable link and scroll through the lyics to sing along!
